This project involved a variety of data cleaning and data exploration
techniques in order to organize, clean and review data from the
FBI's National Instant Check System and from the national census.

I employed a number of methods and functions in the data cleaning
phase.  Those include transposing the data, applying functions to
entire DataFrames with the apply method, and a number of standard methods
for cleaning strings in a dataset.  The project also includes a variety
of line plots and bar graphs to aid in state-by-state comparisons.

Given the nature of the data and this particular project, the
conclusion consists mainly of general observations rather than
concrete causes and effects.

This was part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
